# leaflet-challenge
For this project I used the USGS GeoJSON Feed that provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, to visualize "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" using leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. I also created a legend and popups to provide additional information.
